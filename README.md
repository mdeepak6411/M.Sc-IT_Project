# Predicting Car Price using Machine Learning

## Objective:
The focus of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a car based on its features, in order to make informed purchases.
We implement and evaluate various machine learning methods on a dataset consisting of the sale prices of different makes and models.

## Conclusion:
in this project, i have build three models i.e. Simplen Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression and Polynomial Fit and comparing these three models by using their R-squared and MSE values, we conclude that the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model is the best model to be able to predict price from our dataset. 
This result makes sense, since we have 27 variables in total, and we know that more than one of those variables are potential predictors of the final car price.
